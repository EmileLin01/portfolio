									<h2>EV-Drive: An Open API Specification Project</h2>
									<p>I wrote a YAML file to describe the API of a fictional electric car dealership. Documented endpoints include how to browse the inventory based on
									certain parameters and how to make (and delete) an online order.</p>
									<p>I've been learning about API documentation in my spare time for the past few months. This project is simply a culmination of my learnings. Drop in again in a few months to see 
									what I've picked up next.</p>

										<h2>A Mock<br />
										Data Integration Guide</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/prophix.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I wrote this guide as part of my application for the technical writer position at Prophix Software Ltd. The content is based on a 20-minute conversation with two engineers, so it's far from
									specific and comprehensive.</p>
									<p>This work shows my ability to understand technical concepts with minimal consultation, organize them in a logical fashion, and explain them succinctly. Everything is coded via LaTeX from scratch.</p>

										<h2>SQLing Animals</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/animals.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>My responsibilities occasionally require me to tangle with SQL queries. In this project, I query and analyze longevity statistics of various zoo animals to show you that I'm perfectly capable of handling
									intermediate-to-advanced SQL queries and that I can absolutely contribute to work that requires this skill.</p>
									<p>I created the resulting HTML document using Asciidoctor and a lightly customized CSS stylesheet.</p>

										For Nectari</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/nectari_1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>As part of an interview assessment for Nectari Software Inc., I've created a mock online help system using ClickHelp (trial version) to describe, explain, and organize their new 
									"Formula Wizard" feature. The server hosting the online help system has expired, so I can only show you a write-up of my mock-up.</p>
									<p>An offer was extended, but I chose not to take it.</p>

										<h2>Rare Diseases:<br />
										A Freelancing Project</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/rare.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>To keep my copywriting relevant, I occasionally take up freelancing contracts when I have time. In this case, I wrote a press release for a US non-profit 
									to raise awareness about rare diseases. The article was successfully picked up by a media outlet.</p>
									<p>This sample shows that I can navigate through academic literature, interpret scientific results, identify relevant statistics, and convert my findings into informative and persuasive copy.</p>

										<h2>Homebrew<br />
										D&D Lore</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/wuxia.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I wrote some lore about a wuxia-inspired guild of wandering warriors that I came up with. A writing exercise more than anything else, this document aims to demonstrate my creative writing chops. </p>
									<p>For those curious, the document was formatted using Homebrewery, which allows creators to produce D&D-style content with minimal markdown knowledge.</p>

										D&D Items</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/items.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I created a compendium of homebrew D&D weapons, armours, and other wondrous items based on the equipment of my favourite League of Legends characters. I wrote a flavour
									text for each entry as well as their 5e-based gameplay mechanics.</p>
									<p>By sharing this project with you, I attempt to showcase my copywriting, technical writing, and LaTeX skills.</p>

										<h2>Solar Energy in <br />
										Mozambique</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/solar.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>CPCS, a global infrastructure consulting firm, found a way around Mozambique's energy deficiency, which is to store solar energy in batteries. Eager to share its solution with the world, CPCS hired me to ghostwrite <a href="https://cpcs.ca/pairing-solar-energy-with-battery-storage-in-mozambique/" target="_blank"><u>a thought leadership article</u></a> detailing its energy procurement strategy. The 
									article was later picked up by Energy Global, a leading magazine in electrical engineering, receiving wide readership.</p>
									<p>This article speaks to my ability to ask the right questions to experts and to repackage their answers into a story that appeals to a broad audience.</p>

										Jarvan ADC?!</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/Jarvan_image.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I wrote a guide (incomplete) on how to play as Jarvan ADC in League of Legends. If these words don't ring any bells to you, that's okay. Download the guide anyway and check out
									my presentation skills in Adobe Xd.</p>

										<h2>After the Pivot â€” <br />
										Now What?</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/pivot.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I wrote this essay in 2015 in partial completion of my Master's degree. The work was subsequently published by the Journal of Military and Strategic Studies and was awarded the <a href="https://jmss.org/article/view/58162" target="_blank"><u>best essay in the volume</u></a>.</p>
									<p>This achievement is included here as a testament to my ability to research and digest complex sources, form a unique position based on the literature, and persuasively defend it in a clear and elegant manner.</p>
